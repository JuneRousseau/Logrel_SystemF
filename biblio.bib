  abstract = {This note is based on lectures by Lars Birkedal and work written by Ale\v{s} Bizjak and Kasper Svendsen among others. In Section 1, a unary model for F{$\mu$},refis sketched. The main point of Section 1 is to motivate and explain the challenges that appear when we consider a language with references (Subsection 1.4 on c.o.f.e.'s is precise, the remaining subsections are somewhat sketched). Section 2 presents a relational model. This presentation is again formally precise.},

  abstract = {Logical relations arguments are usually phrased non-compositionally, so as to appear artificially distant from denotational semantics. We describe how a small amount of refactoring and notational adjustment exhibits standard logical relations arguments as an instance of denotational semantics. In this chapter, we work in a provisional and unstructured way, avoiding category theory at the cost of some precision.},

  abstract = {Iris is a framework for higher-order concurrent separation logic, which has been implemented in the Coq proof assistant and deployed very effectively in a wide variety of verification projects. Iris was designed with the express goal of simplifying and consolidating the foundations of modern separation logics, but it has evolved over time, and the design and semantic foundations of Iris itself have yet to be fully written down and explained together properly in one place. Here, we attempt to fill this gap, presenting a reasonably complete picture of the latest version of Iris (version 3.1), from first principles and in one coherent narrative.},
